## Casper's Redesign
!! NOT DONE W.I.P !!

This redesign is a work in progress, released so that people can continue working on it. I have added a custom shop system as prod, and a crafting system (work in progress).
Use common sense, and feel free to join my Discord so we can share ideas and create more things together.

Do not resell, I have chosen to make it available to everyone so you don't have to pay a lot for a redesign that doesn't even work.
Remember to build the inventory before use, otherwise it's just plug n' play. (few items have been added)

## Missing items & bugs

- Crafting (ui is done) - feel free to fork and make crafting so we can all enjoy it. :)
- Utility (ui is done) - feel free to fork and make crafting so we can all enjoy it. :)
- Searchbar may have a problem with movement.

- Target error inside client.lua with limitless-targeting (convert it to ox_target)
- Delete all items if you get errors and make your own.
- If there are more errors, as this version is for a custom framework, please let us know.

## ✨ Features

- Drag n' Drop shop.
- Custom crafting system (wip)
- Inspired and perfected design.
- Rarity system.
- Utility System (ui only so far) -hidden.

        }
    end

    if currency == 'cash' then
        local count = Inventory.GetItemCount(inv, 'money')
        if count >= price then return true end
